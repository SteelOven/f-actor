## Overview

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper
**[F-Actor: Controllable Conversational Behaviour in Full-Duplex Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11329)**.

Spoken conversational systems require more than accurate speech generation to have human-like conversations: to feel natural and engaging, they must produce conversational behaviour that adapts dynamically to the context. Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation. We propose a single-stage training protocol and systematically analyze design choices. Both the model and training code will be released to enable reproducible research on controllable full-duplex speech systems.

Models and datasets will be released on HuggingFace soon.

## Requirements

```
conda create -n factor python=3.10
conda activate factor
cd f-actor
pip install .
```

## Training

Example training scripts are located in [`scripts/train`](scripts/train/).

### Usage

1. Adapt an existing training script to your needs using an example script from [`scripts/train`](scripts/train/). More parameters can be found in [`arguments.py`](training/arguments/arguments.py).

2. Run the training:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/train/your-train-script.sh
   ```

---

## Inference

Example inference scripts for generating dialogues using two instances of the model and prompts from Behavior-SD can be found in [`scripts/inference_eval`](scripts/inference_eval/). If you like to run inference with F-Actor from HuggingFace, please refer to `scripts/inference_eval/inference_nanocodec_special_tokens.sh`.

### Usage

1. Adapt an inference script to your needs using an example script from [`scripts/inference_eval`](scripts/inference_eval/).
2. Run inference:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/inference_eval/your-inference-script.sh
   ```
   The generated dialogues will be stored in the output directory that is specified in the script.

---

## Evaluation

To run the same evaluation metrics as reported in the paper:

1. Add the path of your model to the evaluation script in [`scripts/inference_eval`](scripts/inference_eval/).
   Add the output directory that was used during inference.

2. Run:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/inference_eval/eval.sh
   ```

## Generate Your Own Dialogues
You can generate custom dialogues using the script
[`training/inference_example.py`](training/inference_example.py).
The dialogue is configured via a JSON file
([`confs/example_dialogue.json`](confs/example_dialogue.json) by default),
with the following options per speaker:

- **`name`** (determines the voice used for each character)
  - Four example speaker voices from the original Behaviour-SD are provided below.
    Select any two of these voices for your dialogue.
    - **Tom** [`tom.wav`](training/example_speakers/tom.wav)
    - **Brian** [`brian.wav`](training/example_speakers/brian.wav)
    - **Gweneth** [`gweneth.wav`](training/example_speakers/gweneth.wav)
    - **Rebeka** [`rebeka.wav`](training/example_speakers/rebeka.wav)
- **`narrative`** (background or setup for the dialogue; each speaker only sees their own)
- **`starts`** (which speaker begins the conversation)
- **`backchannels`** / **`interruptions`** (behavior instruction counts)

plus top-level `output_dir` (default `outputs/`), `output_file`, `max_length`,
and sampling parameters (`temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`). The generated audio
(stereo + one mono file per speaker) is written to `output_dir`, together with
a `<name>.json` containing both transcripts and the config that produced them;
the transcripts are also printed at the end.

To run the script, use:

```bash
python training/inference_example.py [--config path/to/my_dialogue.json]
```


## Example Dialogues 
Example dialogues generated with F-Actor can be found in the [`example_dialogues`](example_dialogues/) folder.
